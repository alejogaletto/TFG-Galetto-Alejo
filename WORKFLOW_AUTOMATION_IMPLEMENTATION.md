# Workflow Automation System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `supabase/migrations/add-workflow-triggers.sql`

Created two new tables:
- **WorkflowTrigger**: Stores associations between workflows and their triggers (forms or database tables)
- **WorkflowExecution**: Logs execution history with status, logs, and error information

### 2. Backend Services

#### Workflow Execution Service
**File:** `lib/workflow-execution-service.ts`

Features:
- Server-side workflow execution with proper logging
- Email step execution with variable substitution (`{{field}}` syntax)
- Database CRUD operations (create, update, delete records)
- Condition evaluation
- Context-aware variable resolution
- Execution logging to database

#### Workflow Trigger Service
**File:** `lib/workflow-trigger-service.ts`

Features:
- Detect workflows triggered by form submissions
- Detect workflows triggered by database changes
- Filter triggers by operation type (create, update, delete)
- Execute all matching workflows with proper context
- CRUD operations for trigger management

### 3. API Endpoints

#### `/api/workflow-triggers`
- **POST**: Create new trigger association
- **GET**: List triggers with filtering
- **DELETE** `/api/workflow-triggers/[id]`: Remove trigger

#### `/api/workflows/execute`
- **POST**: Execute workflow with context data

#### Updated Endpoints with Trigger Hooks
- `/api/form-submissions` - Triggers workflows after form submission
- `/api/business-data` - Triggers workflows on record create
- `/api/business-data/[id]` - Triggers workflows on update/delete

### 4. Frontend - Workflow Builder

**File:** `app/dashboard/workflows/create/page.tsx`

New Features:
- Trigger configuration UI in Step 2
- Add/remove triggers dialog
- Form submission trigger selection
- Database change trigger selection with operation filters
- Visual display of configured triggers
- Backend persistence of workflows and triggers

### 5. Type Definitions

**File:** `lib/types.ts`

Added:
- `WorkflowTrigger` type
- `WorkflowExecution` type

## üéØ How It Works

### Form Submission Flow
1. User submits a form via `/api/form-submissions`
2. Data is stored in FormSubmission or BusinessData
3. System checks for workflows triggered by this form
4. Workflows execute with form data as context
5. Email actions use `{{field_name}}` to access form data
6. Database actions can create/update records with form data

### Database Change Flow
1. CRUD operation on BusinessData table
2. System checks for workflows triggered by this table
3. Filters by operation type (create/update/delete)
4. Workflows execute with record data as context
5. Actions can send emails or modify other tables

### Variable Substitution
Workflows support dynamic variables in email and database actions:
- Form fields: `{{field_name}}`
- Record fields: `{{column_name}}`
- System variables: `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{datetime}}`
- Nested properties: `{{user.email}}`

## üìù Usage Example

### Creating a Workflow with Triggers

1. **Navigate** to Workflow Builder (Step 2)
2. **Click** "A√±adir Trigger"
3. **Select** trigger type:
   - Form Submission: Choose which form
   - Database Change: Choose table + operations
4. **Configure** workflow steps:
   - Email: Use `{{field}}` for dynamic content
   - Database: Map fields from trigger to target table
5. **Save** - Workflow and triggers persist to database

### Automatic Execution

Once configured, workflows execute automatically:
- Form submitted ‚Üí Workflow runs
- Record created ‚Üí Workflow runs
- Record updated ‚Üí Workflow runs
- Record deleted ‚Üí Workflow runs

## üîß Technical Details

### Context Structure
```typescript
{
  // Form submission context
  form_id: number,
  submission_id?: number,
  [field_name]: any, // Form field values
  
  // Database change context
  table_id: number,
  record_id: number,
  operation: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete',
  [column_name]: any, // Record field values
}
```

### Email Step Configuration
```typescript
{
  recipient: "{{email}}", // Can use variables
  subject: "Welcome {{name}}!",
  body: "Hello {{name}}, thank you for {{action}}",
  template?: "welcome" | "notification" | etc.,
  cc?: string,
  bcc?: string,
  priority?: "high" | "normal" | "low"
}
```

### Database Step Configuration
```typescript
{
  action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete',
  databaseId: number, // virtual_table_schema_id
  mappings: [
    { source: "form_field", target: "db_column" }
  ],
  recordId?: string, // For update/delete
  condition?: any // For conditional operations
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Remaining Features (Optional)
1. **Form Builder Integration**: Add "Workflows" tab to assign workflows
2. **Workflow Management**: Display trigger info and execution logs
3. **Database Builder Integration**: Assign workflows to table changes
4. **Testing**: End-to-end workflow execution tests

### Testing the System

1. **Create a test workflow:**
   ```
   Trigger: Form submission (Contact Form)
   Step 1: Send email to {{email}} with subject "Thanks {{name}}"
   Step 2: Create record in Customers table
   ```

2. **Submit the form** and verify:
   - Email sent with correct field values
   - Record created in database
   - Execution logged in WorkflowExecution table

3. **Create a database trigger workflow:**
   ```
   Trigger: Customers table (create)
   Step 1: Send email to admin about new customer
   ```

4. **Create a customer** and verify workflow executes

## üìä Database Tables

### WorkflowTrigger
- Links workflows to their triggers
- Supports multiple triggers per workflow
- Stores operation filters for database triggers

### WorkflowExecution
- Logs every workflow run
- Tracks status (running/completed/failed)
- Stores execution logs and errors
- Includes trigger context data

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Automation**: No manual intervention needed
2. **Flexibility**: Workflows run on various triggers
3. **Visibility**: Complete execution logging
4. **Reliability**: Error handling and status tracking
5. **Scalability**: Supports complex multi-step workflows
