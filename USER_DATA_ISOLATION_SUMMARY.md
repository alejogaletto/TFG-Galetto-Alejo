# User Data Isolation Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Layer 1: Application-Level Security (COMPLETED)

**Auth Helpers Created:**
- ‚úÖ `lib/auth-helpers.ts` - Utilities for getting authenticated user ID

**API Routes Updated with user_id Filters:**
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/forms/route.ts` - Filters forms by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/virtual-schemas/route.ts` - Filters databases by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/workflows/route.ts` - Filters workflows by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/solutions/route.ts` - Filters solutions by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/business-data/route.ts` - Filters business data by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/form-submissions/route.ts` - Filters submissions by form ownership

**Key Changes:**
1. All API GET endpoints now require authentication
2. All API GET endpoints filter by `user_id = authenticated_user_id`
3. All API POST endpoints use authenticated user's ID, not from request body
4. Form submissions are public (anyone can submit) but only viewable by form owner
5. Unauthorized requests return 401 status

### Layer 2: Database-Level Security (SQL READY)

**RLS Policies Created:**
- ‚úÖ SQL migration file: `supabase/migrations/add_rls_policies.sql`

**Tables with RLS Policies:**
1. **Form** - Users can only CRUD their own forms
2. **VirtualSchema** - Users can only CRUD their own databases
3. **Workflow** - Users can only CRUD their own workflows
4. **Solution** - Users can only CRUD their own solutions
5. **BusinessData** - Users can only CRUD their own business data

**Child Tables with RLS (inherit through parent):**
- FormField ‚Üí through Form
- FormSubmission ‚Üí public insert, owner read only
- WorkflowStep ‚Üí through Workflow
- WorkflowTrigger ‚Üí through Workflow
- VirtualTableSchema ‚Üí through VirtualSchema
- VirtualFieldSchema ‚Üí through VirtualTableSchema ‚Üí VirtualSchema

## üöÄ How to Apply RLS Policies

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You need to run **TWO migrations** in order!

### Complete Migration Guide:

üìñ **See [`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** for detailed step-by-step instructions.

### Quick Summary:

**Migration 1Ô∏è‚É£** (MUST RUN FIRST): Change `user_id` column type from `INTEGER` to `VARCHAR`
- File: `supabase/migrations/01_migrate_user_id_to_text.sql`
- Why: Your database uses INTEGER, but Supabase Auth uses UUID
- What it does: Converts all user_id columns to support UUIDs

**Migration 2Ô∏è‚É£** (RUN SECOND): Apply RLS policies
- File: `supabase/migrations/add_rls_policies.sql`
- Why: Enforce data isolation at database level
- What it does: Creates policies so users only see their own data

### Quick Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. **Run Migration 1**: Copy `01_migrate_user_id_to_text.sql` ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Run
3. **Verify**: Check column types changed
4. **Run Migration 2**: Copy `add_rls_policies.sql` ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Run
5. **Verify**: Check RLS is enabled and policies exist

```sql
-- Verify Migration 1 (column types)
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'Form' AND column_name = 'user_id';
-- Should show: character varying

-- Verify Migration 2 (RLS enabled)
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('Form', 'VirtualSchema', 'Workflow', 'Solution', 'BusinessData');
-- Should show: rowsecurity = true for all
```

## üß™ Testing Data Isolation

### Test Scenario 1: Create Two Test Users

1. **User A (you):**
   - Email: your current OAuth email
   - Already has data in the system

2. **User B (new test user):**
   - Sign up with a different email
   - Or use a different Google account

### Test Scenario 2: Verify Isolation

**For User A:**
1. Login as User A
2. Go to Forms page - you should see YOUR forms
3. Go to Databases page - you should see YOUR databases
4. Go to Workflows page - you should see YOUR workflows

**For User B:**
1. Login as User B (different browser or incognito)
2. Go to Forms page - should be EMPTY or only User B's forms
3. Go to Databases page - should be EMPTY or only User B's forms
4. Go to Workflows page - should be EMPTY or only User B's workflows

**Key Test:** User B should NOT see any of User A's data!

### Test Scenario 3: API Level Testing

Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab:

**Test 1: GET /api/forms**
- Should only return forms where `user_id = current_user_id`
- Check response JSON - all items should have your user_id

**Test 2: POST /api/forms without user_id in body**
- Should still create form with authenticated user's ID
- Check created form - should have correct user_id

**Test 3: Try to access another user's form**
- Get a form ID from another user (if you have test data)
- Try to GET/PUT/DELETE it
- Should return 404 or 403 error

## üîç What This Fixes

### Before Implementation:
‚ùå User A could see User B's forms, databases, workflows
‚ùå API queries returned ALL data from all users
‚ùå No authorization checks
‚ùå Security vulnerability - data leak

### After Implementation:
‚úÖ User A can only see User A's data
‚úÖ User B can only see User B's data
‚úÖ API queries filtered by authenticated user ID
‚úÖ Database enforces access control automatically
‚úÖ Defense in depth - two layers of security

## üìä Impact on Existing Data

### Orphaned Data (data without user_id):
- Data with `user_id = NULL` will become invisible to all users
- Data with `user_id` not matching any auth user will be invisible

### Options:
1. **Leave as-is** - Orphaned data becomes inaccessible (safest)
2. **Assign to admin** - Update orphaned records to your user_id
3. **Delete** - Remove test data that doesn't belong to anyone

**Recommended SQL to fix orphaned data (if needed):**
```sql
-- Option 1: Find orphaned records
SELECT 'Form' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM "Form" WHERE user_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Workflow', COUNT(*) FROM "Workflow" WHERE user_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'VirtualSchema', COUNT(*) FROM "VirtualSchema" WHERE user_id IS NULL;

-- Option 2: Assign orphaned data to a specific user (replace YOUR_USER_ID)
UPDATE "Form" SET user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE "Workflow" SET user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE "VirtualSchema" SET user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE "Solution" SET user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
UPDATE "BusinessData" SET user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' WHERE user_id IS NULL;
```

## üéØ What's Next

### Dashboard Pages (STILL TO DO)
The API routes are secured, but dashboard pages might still need updates if they query Supabase directly (not through API routes).

**Files that might need attention:**
- `app/dashboard/forms/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/databases/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/workflows/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/solutions/page.tsx`

**What to check:**
- Do they call API routes? ‚úÖ Already secured
- Do they query Supabase directly? ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add `.eq('user_id', userId)`

**Test by:**
1. Open each dashboard page
2. Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Look for API calls or direct Supabase queries
4. Verify data is filtered correctly

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Developers:
1. ‚úÖ Always use `getServerUserId()` in API routes
2. ‚úÖ Always use `getCurrentUserId()` in client components
3. ‚úÖ Never trust `user_id` from request body
4. ‚úÖ Always filter queries by authenticated user ID
5. ‚úÖ Test with multiple user accounts

### For Production:
1. ‚úÖ Enable RLS on all tables
2. ‚úÖ Test policies before deploying
3. ‚úÖ Monitor failed authorization attempts
4. ‚úÖ Regular security audits
5. ‚úÖ Keep Supabase and dependencies updated

## üìù Rollback Plan (Emergency Only)

If something goes wrong, you can disable RLS temporarily:

```sql
-- WARNING: This removes all security! Only use for debugging!
ALTER TABLE "Form" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "VirtualSchema" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "Workflow" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "Solution" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "BusinessData" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Then re-enable after fixing issues!**

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After applying changes, verify:

- [ ] RLS is enabled on all main tables
- [ ] Two different users see different data
- [ ] API routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] API routes only return user's own data
- [ ] Creating new resources assigns correct user_id
- [ ] Forms, workflows, databases all show correct data
- [ ] Form submissions work (public can submit, owner can view)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No server errors in logs

- **Plan Document:** `supabase-auth-migration-oauth.plan.md`

## üéâ Conclusion

You now have **defense-in-depth security** with:
1. Application-level filters (API routes)
2. Database-level policies (RLS)

This ensures users can only access their own data, even if there's a bug in the application code!
